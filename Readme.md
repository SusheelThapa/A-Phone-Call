## Project Compilation

We are using [Makefile](Makefile) to compile our project.

1. Compiling Client Code
   ```make
    make client_one client
   ```

   It will create two client `client_one` and `client_two`.

2. Compiling Server Code

   ```make
    make server
   ```

   It will create `server`.

3. Clean command

   ```make
    make clean
   ```

   It will clean the working directory by removing all those file created using [Makefile](Makefile)
