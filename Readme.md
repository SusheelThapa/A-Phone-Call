## Project Compilation

We are using [Makefile](Makefile) to compile our project.

1. Build Command

   ```make
    make build
   ```

   It will create the necessary object file for the project.

2. Clean command

   ```make
    make clean
   ```

   It will clean the working directory by removing all those file created using [Makefile](Makefile)

3. Run command

   ```make
    make run
   ```

   It will first run the [build](#project-compilation) to create necessary object file in [build folder](build/) and run the project executable file.
